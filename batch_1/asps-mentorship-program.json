    "PROPEL is a mentorship program that brings together teams of plastic surgeons at various stages of their careers to foster greater collaboration and a meaningful mentorship experience. Teams consist of a combination of senior and junior faculty and residents. The goal of each group is to build relationships and create a continuum of learning opportunities that reflect the vast, yet overlapping, experiences between faculty members and trainees in a longitudinal manner, offering participants the opportunity to serve as both mentors and mentees.",
    "The application period for the 2025-26 PROPEL program is now open. The PROPEL program is open to ASPS Active Members, International Members, Candidates for Membership, Life Members, Residents and Fellows. Please note that when applying, you will be expected to actively participate and meet with your team virtually at least once per quarter. Spots are limited, and applications are being accepted through July 31. Teams will be announced prior to Plastic Surgery The Meeting 2025, allowing in-person attendees the opportunity to meet their team members.",

in PRS Education and Leadership\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPROPEL is a mentorship program that brings together teams of plastic surgeons at various stages of their careers to foster greater collaboration and a meaningful mentorship experience. Teams consist of a combination of senior and junior faculty and residents. The goal of each group is to build relationships and create a continuum of learning opportunities that reflect the vast, yet overlapping, experiences between faculty members and trainees in a longitudinal manner, offering participants the opportunity to serve as both mentors and mentees.\nPROPEL Guidebook\nThe application period for the 2025-26 PROPEL program is now open.
