\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA breast lift, also known as mastopexy, raises the breasts by removing excess skin and tightening the surrounding tissue to reshape and support the new breast contour.Sometimes the areola becomes enlarged over time, and a breast lift will reduce this as well.A breast lift can rejuvenate your figure with a breast profile that is more youthful and uplifted. A woman's breasts often change over time, losing their youthful shape and firmness. These changes and loss of skin elasticity can result from:PregnancyBreastfeedingWeight fluctuationsAgingGravityHeredityWhat breast lift surgery can't doBreast lift surgery does not significantly change the size of your breasts or round out the upper part of your breast. If you want your breasts to look fuller, consider breast lift and breast augmentation.If you want smaller breasts, consider combining breast lift and breast reduction. \n\n\n\n\n\nNext: Candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                Table of Contents\r\n            \n\n\r\n                Print\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Introduction\r\n                        \n\n\n\r\n                                Candidates\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Cost\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Consultation\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Questions to Ask\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Risks and Safety\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Preparation\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Procedure Steps\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Recovery\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Results\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Before and After Photos\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Glossary of Terms\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Choosing a Plastic Surgeon\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Visual Animation\r\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Your Surgeon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Blogs\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n        Redefining breast surgery with internal bras\r\n\r\n            \r\n                Ariel Frankeny \r\n            \n\n\r\n            Also known as soft tissue matrices, the internal bra is used in combination with breast surgeries, such as a breast augmentation, lift or reduction, to enhance results.\r\n        \n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        What's on the horizon?
