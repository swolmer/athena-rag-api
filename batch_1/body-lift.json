    "A body lift improves the shape and tone of the underlying tissue that supports skin and fat. Excess sagging skin and fat are removed and the procedure(s) can improve a dimpled, irregular skin surface.",
    "Aging, sun damage, pregnancy, significant fluctuations in weight and genetic factors may contribute to poor tissue elasticity that can result in sagging of the abdomen, buttocks and thighs.",
    "Body lifts are not intended strictly for the removal of excess fat. Liposuction alone can remove excess fat deposits where skin has good elasticity and is able to naturally conform to new body contours. In cases where skin elasticity is poor, body lift techniques along with liposuction may be recommended.",
    "Many patients are familiar with tried-and-true classics like liposuction and the tummy tuck, yet they may be unfamiliar with belt lipectomy. Also known as a lower body lift, this aesthetic procedure addresses the appearance of the lower body by removing sagging skin and tissue that can result from aging or dramatic weight loss."

Excess sagging skin and fat are removed and the procedure(s) can improve a dimpled, irregular skin surface.A body lift may include these areasAbdominal area – locally or extending around the sides and into the lower back areaButtocksThigh – the inner, outer or posterior thigh, or the thigh's circumferenceAging, sun damage, pregnancy, significant fluctuations in weight and genetic factors may contribute to poor tissue elasticity that can result in sagging of the abdomen, buttocks and thighs.What a body lift can't doBody lifts are not intended strictly for the removal of excess fat. Liposuction alone can remove excess fat deposits where skin has good elasticity and is able to naturally conform to new body contours. In cases where skin elasticity is poor, body lift techniques along with liposuction may be recommended. \n\n\n\n\n\nNext: Candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                Table of Contents\r\n            \n\n\r\n                Print\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Introduction\r\n                        \n\n\n\r\n                                Candidates\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Cost\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Consultation\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Questions to Ask\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Risks and Safety\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Preparation\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Procedure\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Recovery\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Results\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Glossary of Terms\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Choosing a Plastic Surgeon\r\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Your Surgeon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Blogs\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n        The basics of the belt lipectomy\r\n\r\n            \r\n                Ariel Frankeny \r\n            \n\n\r\n            Many patients are familiar with tried-and-true classics like liposuction and the tummy tuck, yet they may be unfamiliar with belt lipectomy.
