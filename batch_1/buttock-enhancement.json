    "Buttock augmentation improves the contour, size and shape of the buttocks. A buttock lift improves the tone of the underlying tissue in the buttocks. A Brazilian butt lift is a common buttock enhancement procedure.",
    "Buttock augmentation, or gluteal augmentation, is used to improve the contour, size and/or shape of the buttocks. This is done through the use of buttock implants, fat grafting or sometimes a combination of the two.",
    "Buttock implants are silicone-filled devices that are surgically placed deep within the tissues of the buttock. Buttock augmentation through the use of fat grafting involves the transfer of fat from one area of the body into the tissues of the buttocks. This technique is sometimes referred to as a Brazilian butt lift.",
    "Plastic Surgery Societies Issue Urgent Warning About the Risks Associated with Brazilian Butt Lifts",
    "In addition to buttock augmentation procedures, a buttock lift can be accomplished by the surgical removal of soft tissue.",
    "A buttock lift, or gluteal lift, improves the shape and tone of the underlying tissue that supports skin and fat in the buttock area.",
    "Aging, sun damage, pregnancy, significant fluctuations in weight and genetic factors may contribute to poor tissue elasticity that can result in sagging of the buttocks.",
    "In order to achieve a smoother and more pleasing contour, excess sagging skin and fat are removed. A traditional gluteal lift will not make a butt larger, but may improve a dimpled, irregular skin surface. This procedure may be included in a body lift or may be performed separately.",
    "Buttock lifts are not intended strictly for the removal of excess fat nor are they intended to add volume to the buttocks. Fat grafting, buttock implants or auto-augmentation (when some of your own tissue is left underneath the skin) can be used to add volume. Liposuction is sometimes added for better contouring.",
    "There's no buts about it. While the Brazilian butt lift remains popular, we're saying hello to a new procedure arriving from middle America â€“ the Topeka tush.",
    "\"I feel like now we might be on the cusp of starting to see patients coming in requesting a reversal, or if they do want a BBL, perhaps not that overly exaggerated or heavily augmented look. A lot of patients want something that's more natural-looking.\""

This is done through the use of buttock implants, fat grafting or sometimes a combination of the two.Buttock implants are silicone-filled devices that are surgically placed deep within the tissues of the buttock. Buttock augmentation through the use of fat grafting involves the transfer of fat from one area of the body into the tissues of the buttocks. This technique is sometimes referred to as a Brazilian butt lift. Plastic Surgery Societies Issue Urgent Warning About the Risks Associated with Brazilian Butt Lifts What buttock augmentation surgery can doIncrease fullness, roundness and projection of your butt or buttocksImprove the balance of your figureEnhance your self-image and self-confidenceIn addition to buttock augmentation procedures, a buttock lift can be accomplished by the surgical removal of soft tissue.Buttock liftA buttock lift, or gluteal lift, improves the shape and tone of the underlying tissue that supports skin and fat in the buttock area.Aging, sun damage, pregnancy, significant fluctuations in weight and genetic factors may contribute to poor tissue elasticity that can result in sagging of the buttocks.In order to achieve a smoother and more pleasing contour, excess sagging skin and fat are removed. A traditional gluteal lift will not make a butt larger, but may improve a dimpled, irregular skin surface. This procedure may be included in a body lift or may be performed separately.What a buttock lift can't doButtock lifts are not intended strictly for the removal of excess fat nor are they intended to add volume to the buttocks. Fat grafting, buttock implants or auto-augmentation (when some of your own tissue is left underneath the skin) can be used to add volume. Liposuction is sometimes added for better contouring. \n\n\n\n\n\nNext: Candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                Table of Contents\r\n            \n\n\r\n                Print\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Introduction\r\n                        \n\n\n\r\n                                Candidates\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Cost\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Consultation\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Questions to Ask\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Risks and Safety\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Preparation\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Procedure Steps\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Recovery\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Results\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Before and After Photos\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Choosing a Plastic Surgeon\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Visual Animation\r\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Your Surgeon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatest Blogs\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n        The \"Topeka tush\" rises as the exaggerated Brazilian butt lift shrinks\r\n\r\n            \r\n                Daisy Brumby \r\n            \n\n\r\n            There's no buts about it.
