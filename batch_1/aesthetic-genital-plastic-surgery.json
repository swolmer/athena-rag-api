    "There are a variety of aesthetic genital plastic surgery procedures that may enhance appearance and reduce discomfort. These procedures include labiaplasty, clitoral hood reduction, labia majoraplasty, monsplasty and vaginoplasty.",
    "Patients also sometimes refer to these procedures as female genital cosmetic surgery, vaginal rejuvenation, female genital rejuvenation surgery, vulvovaginal plastic surgery and designer vagina surgery, among other terms.",
    "Before discussing each of these procedures, it is important to look at the anatomy.",
    "The hair-bearing area over the pubic bone at the upper portion of the female genitalia is called the mons. The hair-bearing outer lips are called the labia majora (singular is labium majus). The inner lips are called the labia minora (singular is labium minus). In the upper portion in the center is the clitoral hood, sometimes called the prepuce, which covers the clitoris in part or entirely. Below the clitoris is the urethral opening, and below that is the vaginal opening.",
    "Now let's look take a closer look at what aesthetic genital plastic surgery procedures are available to women.",
    "A labiaplasty is a plastic surgery procedure that reduces the size and proportions of the labia minora, or inner vaginal lips. During a labiaplasty, your plastic surgeon may also recommend a clitoral hood reduction, which reduces excess skin around the clitoris."

These procedures include labiaplasty, clitoral hood reduction, labia majoraplasty, monsplasty and vaginoplasty.Patients also sometimes refer to these procedures as female genital cosmetic surgery, vaginal rejuvenation, female genital rejuvenation surgery, vulvovaginal plastic surgery and designer vagina surgery, among other terms.Before discussing each of these procedures, it is important to look at the anatomy.External anatomy of the female genitaliaThe hair-bearing area over the pubic bone at the upper portion of the female genitalia is called the mons. The hair-bearing outer lips are called the labia majora (singular is labium majus). The inner lips are called the labia minora (singular is labium minus). In the upper portion in the center is the clitoral hood, sometimes called the prepuce, which covers the clitoris in part or entirely. Below the clitoris is the urethral opening, and below that is the vaginal opening.Now let's look take a closer look at what aesthetic genital plastic surgery procedures are available to women. \n\n\n\n\n\nNext: Labiaplasty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n                Table of Contents\r\n            \n\n\r\n                Print\r\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Introduction\r\n                        \n\n\n\r\n                                Labiaplasty\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Clitoral Hood Reduction\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Labia Majoraplasty\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Monsplasty\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Vaginoplasty\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Consultation\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Questions to Ask\r\n                            \n\n\n\r\n                                Choosing a Plastic Surgeon\r\n                            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind Your Surgeon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn The Blog\n\n\n\n\r\n\r\n        Adding a clitoral hood reduction to your labiaplasty procedure\r\n\r\n            \r\n                Raffy Karamanoukian, MD, FACS \r\n            \n\n\r\n            A labiaplasty is a plastic surgery procedure that reduces the size and proportions of the labia minora, or inner vaginal lips.
